<body>
  <p> This is a collection of all my Ates and Kuyas (minus the OG DJ Peace).
  <br></br> In such a big organization it's easy to feel alone, but I always have these big homies watching out for me. </p>

        <div class="caption"><h1>Ate Julianne</h1>
          <br></br>
          <p>This is my Ate Julianne! My OG ate. My favorite person to open up to and I don't think there's anyone
          with a better twitter than hers. She's given me the greatest advice for my college experience and she knows it. Vote #Julianne2020.</p>

        <div class="caption"><h1>Kuya Gio</h1>
          <br></br>
          <p>Kuya Gio was the first AKA I ever met. He's extremely nice and it's funny because I edited a photo
          of him to make him look like Goku as a joke, but instead he thought it was super cool. I really appreciate
          having someone so loving in my life.</p>

        <div class="caption"><h1>Kuya Paolo</h1>
          <br></br>
          <p>The other OG Kuya. None of my Ates or Kuyas can relate to the engineering struggle like Kuya Paolo.
          He knows how to listen and avoids petty drama. I aspire to be like Kuya "Go with the Flow" Paolo.
          First thing he ever said to me: "My name is Paolo. It rhymes with hollow."

        <div class="caption"><h1>Ate Sophia</h1>
          <br></br>
          <p>Ate Sophia was my AKA for about a year. We keep in touch despite only meeting in person once.
          She put me on with Anderson .paak, so I'm the real winner here. I wish we had more time together cuz we share a lot views and could've had a bomb time. Invite me to the next set you're working on. You got this ate!</p>

      <img src="images/ateskuya/alex.jpg" alt="" />
      <div class="caption"><h1>Kuya Alex</h1>
        <br></br>
        <p>Kuya Alex requested me to be his ading the first time I met him. No regrets ever since. Kuya Alex is always
        keeping it real and always wants to hang out and check in on me and my sibs. Sometimes we get into deep conversations,
        but my favorite thing is to eat and break high scores at HERE with Kuya ;D
