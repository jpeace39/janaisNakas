  <p> This is a collection of all my adings. PSA's VP-Is have done a wonderful job giving me the best adings. <br></br> In the AKA program you would expect that all the older siblings would be responsible for their younger siblings. That is not the case. I know these kiddies have helped me way more times than I've helped them. Maybe I'm just a bad ate then! :O  </p>

        <div class="caption"><h1>Ading Ysabelle</h1>
          <br></br>
          <p>Who can I relate to better than Ading Ysabelle? I think it's pretty dope that my OG girldings are all in APO now.
          And she's from Walter Payton! My favorite high school after WY. I'm pretty confident I'm always dying of laughter around Ading Ysabelle. We are the dream team goofy kids who always rip their jeans.</p>

        <div class="caption"><h1>Ading Soft Z</h1>
          <br></br>
          <p>She's my ading, but she's also my neighbor I never knew about in Chicago. S/O to you my OG. Out of all my dings, you have grown the most and I could not be prouder.
          Everytime I see you I want to charge at you with a hug, but then I remember your rugby skills would destroy me. You're a wonderful ading and ate. Mahal kita.</p>

        <div class="caption"><h1>Ading Andrew</h1>
          <br></br>
          <p>Andrew is my OG and only boyding. I haven't seen him in about 500 years, but we used to study together. If there's one thing to know about Andrew, it's that he's ambitious and a goof.
          Even though we haven't interacted in awhile, I know he's busy getting his goals together and school comes first!</p>

        <div class="caption"><h1>Ading Michi</h1>
          <br></br>
          <p>Michi and I used to skip class together. Thank you for helping me set a bad example!! Michi's my quietest ading, but that doesn't keep her from being entertaining.
          Definitely my best ading to complain with. We get frustrated with the same things except pineapple pizza...which is totally acceptable. </p>

      <div class="caption"><h1>Ading Ashley</h1>
        <br></br>
        <p>She is beauty. She's a disgrace. She's my favorite ading to annoy. Ading Ashley is lowkey funnier than everyone in PSA. I feel betrayed though cuz she picked up more Ates/Kuyas whose initials weren't JP. One time we saw each other
      3 days in a row and that was probably the best week I've had in all of 2017. Please roast me more often.</p>

    <div class="caption"><h1>Ading Marianne</h1>
      <br></br>
      <p>#Blessed that Ading Marianne is my ading. Who else appreciates classical music the way we do? Who's as awkward as us? We're perfect for each other. You're a good 30% of the reason I enjoy Officer Meetings.
      and you've made this year in PSA the most enjoyable it's ever been because I can always count on you. Stay perfect~</p>
