  <p> This is a collection of all my sibs. Each one of them is special to me in one way or another. Sibs are my favorite because they have to be your friend. No escape!</p>

        <div class="caption"><h1>Sib Vivian</h1>
          <br></br>
          <p>THE OG SIB!!! PSA don't know nothing about the #Turnip$qu@d. We don't see each other too often, but somehow have 500 inside jokes.
            Anytime with Sib Vivian is guaranteed to be a good time. ;D She's super sweet, but that doesn't stop her from being a boss.

        <div class="caption"><h1>Sib Ian</h1>
          <br></br>
          <p>Sib Ian can sing so nothing else matters. </p>

        <div class="caption"><h1>Sib Mac</h1>
          <br></br>
          <p>I still don't know if I should call him Sib Mac, Sib Arthur, or Sib Macarthur. Even though he's my OG sib. Oh well! Fun fact: We have matching Sriracha outfits thanks to Kuya Gio.</p>

        <div class="caption"><h1>Sib Jamie</h1>
          <br></br>
          <p>The sib I never asked for but still weaseled her way into my life and PSA family. We've been friends since 7th grade and now roommates for almost three years.
          She has actually turned into my little annoying sibling. I spend most of my day thinking about when the next time I can fight her will be. Arguably my best friend.</p>

      <div class="caption"><h1>Sib Tia</h1>
        <br></br>
        <p>Sib Tia rejuvenated my love for PSA. I owe her a lot for that. The first time we met, we hit it off, but nothing can describe the excitement when we found out we were actually sibs under Kuya Gio (who neglected to tell us).
        With Sib Tia I feel like I don't have to hold back, because she'll match or beat me on the level of wildness.</p>

    <div class="caption"><h1>Sib Julianne</h1>
      <br></br>
      <p>My double AKA. She's my sib and my ate. Now that she's off campus, I spend most of my time reminiscing with her former roommates about how funny she was.</p>

  <div class="caption"><h1>Sib Alexa</h1>
    <br></br>
    <p>Sib Alexa is always welcome to be on my Snapchat. I think we should do a snaprap together. To be honest though, Sib Alexa and her Kuya Marc are AKA goals.</p>

  <div class="caption"><h1>Sib Kristy</h1>
    <br></br>
    <p>We originally requested to be ate-ading, but we were denied lol. Now we're sibs.
      We've been part of a family since before UIUC, so I'm happy we can continue it here.
      I have nothing but good things to say about Sib Kristy. WEZBEZ4LYFE.

  <div class="caption"><h1>Sib Tyler</h1>
    <br></br>
    <p>My prized sib, Sib Tyler. My best memory of him was of him getting auctioned for a ton of money at a date auction.
    Doesn't surprise me much because he's the full package.</p>

  <div class="caption"><h1>Sib Alanna</h1>
    <br></br>
    <p>I have always lowkey wished that Alanna would become my sib. Not just cuz she always laughs at my jokes, but that is a big reason why. Thank you for making me feel loved.</p>
